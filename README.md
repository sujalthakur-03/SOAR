# SOAR
SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) is a security technology that helps organizations improve their incident response, threat management, and security operations by integrating various security tools and automating repetitive tasks.

In our SOAR, I have integrated WAZUH, THEHIVE, CORTEX and SHUFFLE.
